# Learn-Natural-Language-Processing-Curriculum
This is the curriculum for "Learn Natural Language Processing" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

## Course Objective
This is the Curriculum for [this](https://youtu.be/GazFsfcijXQ) video on Learn Natural Language Processing by Siraj Raval on Youtube. After completing this course, start your own startup, do consulting work, or find a full-time job related to NLP.
Remember to believe in your ability to learn. You can learn NLP , you will learn NLP, and if you stick to it,
eventually you will master it.
